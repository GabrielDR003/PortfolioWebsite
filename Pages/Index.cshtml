        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a junior full-stack developer with a strong foundation in building secure, data-driven web applications using the Microsoft 
          stack - including C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. My passion lies in delivering clean, scalable code and building
          software that’s both user-friendly and performance-optimized.</p>

          <p>During my senior capstone project, I led the development of a full-stack fitness app that integrated with third-party APIs using OAuth
          2.0, implemented background services, and featured real-time leaderboards - all deployed on Azure. The experience gave me real-world insight
            into full product development, from designing database schemas to writing automated tests and deploying via CI pipelines.</p>


          <p>I’m currently seeking junior developer opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects, continue growing as a developer, and 
          collaborate with experienced engineers. I bring curiosity, attention to detail, and a growth mindset to everything I work on.</p>
