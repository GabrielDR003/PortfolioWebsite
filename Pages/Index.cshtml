                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a junior full-stack developer with a strong foundation in building secure, 
                    data-driven web applications using the Microsoft stack — including C#, 
                    ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. My passion lies in delivering 
                    clean, scalable code and building software that’s both user-friendly and 
                    performance-optimized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my senior capstone project, I led the development of a full-stack 
                    fitness app that integrated with third-party APIs using OAuth 2.0, implemented 
                    background services, and featured real-time leaderboards — all deployed on Azure. 
                    The experience gave me real-world insight into full product development, from 
                    designing database schemas to writing automated tests and deploying via CI pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m currently seeking junior developer opportunities where I can contribute to 
                    meaningful projects, continue growing as a developer, and collaborate with 
                    experienced engineers. I bring curiosity, attention to detail, and a growth 
                    mindset to everything I work on.
                </p>
